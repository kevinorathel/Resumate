Resumate



1. Define Scope & Features
Decide on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features:
> User inputs personal details (name, experience, skills, etc.)
> User provides a job description
> AI generates a tailored resume
> Download resume as PDF

(Optional: Cover letter generator, resume templates, job tracker, etc.)


2. Choose Tech Stack
Frontend:

React (for UI)
TailwindCSS/Material-UI (for styling)
Backend:

Java (Spring Boot) for API development
Gemini API for AI-generated resume content
MySQL Database (if needed for user profiles & saved resumes):

MySQL for structured data
MongoDB for flexible storage


3. Set Up the Development Environment
Initialize a React project:
sh
Copy
Edit
npx create-react-app resume-builder
cd resume-builder
npm install
Set up a FastAPI (Python) backend:
sh
Copy
Edit
pip install fastapi uvicorn openai
Create an API key for OpenAI and store it securely.


4. Build the UI (Frontend)
Create a form for user input (Name, Experience, Skills, Job Description).
Add a preview section to display the generated resume.
Add a download as PDF button (Use react-to-print or jspdf).


5. Implement the AI Logic (Backend)
Send user details & job description to the Gemini API:


def generate_resume(user_data, job_description):  
    prompt = f"Generate a resume for {user_data} based on this job: {job_description}"  
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(  
        model="gpt-4",  
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]  
    )  
    return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]  
Return the generated resume to the frontend.


6. Connect Frontend & Backend
Use Axios to send requests from React to FastAPI/Spring Boot.
Display the generated resume dynamically.


7. Add Export Functionality
Use jsPDF or react-to-print to enable PDF downloads.
Allow saving resumes in the database for future edits.


8. Deploy & Test
Frontend: Vercel/Netlify
Backend: Render/Fly.io/Heroku
Database: Supabase (if using PostgreSQL)
Next Steps & Enhancements
Improve Resume Formatting: Add predefined resume templates.
AI Enhancements: Make the AI refine and improve bullet points.
Cover Letter Generator: Extend AI to generate cover letters.
User Accounts: Allow users to save multiple resumes.
