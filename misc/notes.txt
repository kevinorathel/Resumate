*** Calculating Job Description to User Profile Score ***

	1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency):

		-> Caculate the frequency of the terms in the 'User's Profile' and the 'Job Description'
		-> Find the cosine similarity score between the two
		-> If the similarity score is above a threshold (high value, 80 maybe?), cover letter is generated
		-> If the similarity score is below the threshold, the delta (user score - jd score) is figured and the user can be shown what that delta is in terms of skills?


*** Roadmap ***

	1. Define Scope & Features
		Decide on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features:
		> User inputs personal details (name, experience, skills, etc.)
		> User provides a job description
		> AI generates a tailored resume
		> Download resume as PDF

		(Optional: Cover letter generator, resume templates, job tracker, etc.)


	2. Tech Stack
		
		Frontend:

			React (for UI)
			TailwindCSS/Material-UI (for styling)
		Backend:

			Java (Spring Boot) for API development
			Gemini API for AI-generated resume content
			MySQL Database (if needed for user profiles & saved resumes):

			MySQL for structured data
			MongoDB for flexible storage



	8. Deploy & Test
		Frontend: Vercel/Netlify
		Backend: Render/Fly.io/Heroku
		Database: Supabase (if using PostgreSQL)


***Next Steps & Enhancements***

	Improve Resume Formatting: Add predefined resume templates.
	AI Enhancements: Make the AI refine and improve bullet points.
	Cover Letter Generator: Extend AI to generate cover letters.
	User Accounts: Allow users to save multiple resumes.



** Main Dependencies to add in a Springboot project **

	1. Hibernate (For hibernate things)
	2. MySQL Driver (Or any db driver)
	3. SpringWeb (To build RESTful applications)
